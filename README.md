This repository contains materials, code snippets, and references from my guest lecture delivered on June 11, 2025, as part of the Short-Term Training Program (STTP) on Personalized Medicine through AI and Data Analytics.

Personalized_Medicine_through_AI_and_Data_Analytics.pdf – Covers:

1. Genomics, lifestyle & environmental factors in personalization

2. AI applications in healthcare

3. Challenges in healthcare data

4. 1D signals (e.g., ECG) vs 2D/3D medical imaging

5. ML vs DL in medical imaging

6. Visualization and interpretability tools

CODE SAMPLES:

cnn_classification/ – CNN-based image classification example using Chest X-ray dataset (binary classification: normal vs pneumonia)

detectron2_segmentation/ – Instance segmentation pipeline using Detectron2 (applied to biomedical imagery or sample annotated masks)
